This repository holds several implementation of the algorithms shown in the [Embeded House's blog posts](https://embedded-house.ghost.io/tag/algorithms/), the pourpose of the code you will found is no other than provide with an implementation example, we tried to wrote as simple as posible to make it easy to understand and then used them as a leraning tool.

All of them have been unit tested using ceedling, documented with doxygen and linted with ccpcheck. Just copy and paste them into your own project and start using them. Jut keep in mind mosth of them have been written with the STM32G0 family in mind, but are quiet easy to port to other microcontrollers.

We encourage you to visit our blog and read the post related to the code you are interested in, you will find a lot of information about the algorithm and how to use it.
